This project demonstrates a highly available and secure static website hosting solution on AWS using a hybrid architecture of EC2 and S3. Built after my BootsGalore three-tier migration, this project focuses on right-sizing infrastructure - delivering enterprise-grade reliability without over-engineering.

The problem I solved: How to host a static website with high availability and security without the cost and complexity of a full three-tier architecture (which would include a database tier).

Key Implementations & Achievements : 

• Custom VPC (multi-AZ)
• Application Load Balancer
• EC2 with Apache in private subnets
• S3 for images, CSS, JavaScript
• Least-privilege security groups
